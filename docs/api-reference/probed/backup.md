# Backup APIs (probed)

**Category:** Backup

[← Back to Probed APIs](README.md)

---

These APIs were confirmed against a live DSM 7.4 appliance by probing every
read-shaped method (`list`, `get`, `info`, `status`, `query`, `enum`) at the version the
appliance itself advertises. An entry appears here only because DSM answered for it.

Response blocks are **shapes, not captures** — key names and value *types*, derived on the
appliance so no real hostname, account, share, serial or key ever left it. Where a method
exists but needs arguments, that is stated with the error code rather than guessed at.

Write-shaped methods were not probed: DSM validates `version` *before* `method`, so a
no-argument call to an unknown write method executes it. Those need a disposable appliance.
